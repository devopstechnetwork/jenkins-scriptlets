Jenkins-scriptlets
==================

Useful groovy scripts that can be used while using Jenkins-CI for workflow automation. Many of them support the generation of dynamic build parameters for [Active Choices](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Choices+Plugin) Jenkins form controls

## Scriptlets Supporting Active Choices
See the [this wiki](https://github.com/imoutsatsos/jenkins-scriptlets/wiki/Scriptlets-Supporting-Active-Choices-Parameters) page.
In general, any scriptlet in this repository with a name that starts with AC (active choice) or UC (uno-choice) is designed for configuration in an Active Choice build parameter to create a list of values that users can dynamically select parameter options from. 

### AC-Scriptlet Metadata and Parameters
Most scriptlets in this repository require input parameters to function properly. 
A description for each scriptlet and the required parameters are included in a specially formatted metadata header. If the scriptlet is missing wiki documentation review these metadata for a better understanding of the what the code does and requires as input.

## Other Scriptlets
For a collection of other useful Scriptlets, please, see [this wiki](https://github.com/imoutsatsos/jenkins-scriptlets/wiki/Other-Scriptlets) page.
